Be sure that your gem system is updated:

pre[bash]. gem update --system

Next, install the framework as a gem:

pre[bash]. gem install padrino

This will install the necessary padrino sub-gems to get you started.

Now you are ready to use this gem to enhance your sinatra projects or to create new Padrino applications.
